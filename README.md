# 🚗 Road Accident Severity Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the **severity of road accidents** based on various factors such as road type, weather conditions, vehicle type, and time of day.  
Built with **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project aims to help traffic authorities and safety analysts identify conditions that increase the risk of severe accidents.  
Using logistic regression and data preprocessing, it analyzes key factors influencing accident severity.
